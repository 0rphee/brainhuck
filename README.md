# brainhuck

A Haskell implementation of a Brainfuck interpreter.

The interpeter is implemented as an executable (installed with `stack install` in the directory), which can take 
the path of Brainfuck source code, or using the `--stdin` flag, execute code given as an argument to the 
interpeter.

Usage examples:

```bash
brainhuck path/to/program.b

brainhuck --stdin ">>>>+"

brainhuck program.b -s 100 > debug.txt
```

Flags/Options:   

```bash
-s --size               # memory size (default: 500 cells)
--stdin                 # execute code given as an argument
## -d --debug            # debug mode UNAVAILABLE AT THE MOMENT may return in the future 
```

I have yet to to document the source code at least to some extent, nevertheless I think it's fairly readable, 
though maybe not so idiomatic, since I'm still a Haskell beginner-intermediate.

There are two modules for the interpeter in this project. Their only difference is that one uses Boxed Vectors
for the memory, and the other uses Unboxed Vectors. The difference in performance can be seen in the bench.html
file generated by criterion.

This interpreter allows for different datatypes to be used as the memory used, only requiring for each datatype
a couple of typeclasses, and few more code.
